# Android Stock List App
This is a basic list app. It displays the price of three stocks.
There is also a google button once you press on the stock that 
will check to see if there is a google browser on the device so
you are able to quickly google the stock that is shown if you are
intersted.


This app was to pratice how to resize images taken from the internt 
so the app would not crash because the image size file was too big.
It was also pratice with the list view that android studio provides.
